# Amazon_proj
Hello and welcome to my Amazon website project.

So I was asked to prepare a sales page in the Amazon store to prove my talents in the frontend, the truth is that I really enjoyed messing with it and going through challenge after challenge and feeling the self-satisfaction after breaking my head with Google :).
The challenges in this project:

#Responsiveness: through her I learned what a "mobile first" approach actually is and how important it is in our generation where there is almost no one who does not have a smartphone.
 
#positions: I learned a lot about positions and when to use each one and I got to use them in a project, this is a very useful thing in website design and of course makes the website more accessible and convenient to use.

#flickity - wraparound: I learned another new thing which is wraparound and how to insert images there and I got stuck a bit because I didn't understand at first that I had to download "jquery cdn" and also insert the libraries into the code for the function of "data-flickity-options" to work for me.
